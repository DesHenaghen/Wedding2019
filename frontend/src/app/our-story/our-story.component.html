                <p>Our story began back in September 2013, when we were both freshers at Strathclyde University.
                  During the campus introduction lecture, the presenter ended by joking that ‚Äúuni life is exciting and unpredictable, and who knows, you might even marry the person sitting next to you‚Äù.
                  Indeed Ira was actually sitting next to Des that day :) In fact she winked at Des jokingly, because she recognised him from the course and was in a giddy mood.
                  Throughout the rest of the semester, we became good friends and in only a short few months fell in love!

                <p>Our first big holiday together was an adventure all across Europe. We lived on a farm in Oersberg in the most northern reaches of Germany,
                sampled the best life Christiania has to offer in Denmark and went sunbathing and swimming in Malta.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It was only that summer Ira found out that, while Des has been the knight in shining armour protecting her from spiders for years, he is actually scared of them himself!
                This, admittedly, swept Ira off her feet all over again.</p>

                <p>Our next milestone was moving in together for a university exchange program in Munich for 12 months.
                Along the way we met loads of amazing friends and shared so many wonderful experiences together!
                It was also then that a piggy bank rule in our home was established, so Ira gets cheered up by a cute piggy
                bank when picking up a neverending stream of coins Des manages to scatter around the house.</p>
